    <p>I'm not entierly sure what my favourite drink would be. I have a veriaty of things that I like, but I think one of my favourite drinks would have to be a special concotion of soda and ice cream I get at my favourite restaurant. It sounds disgusting, but it's a Dr Pepper freeze with added Orange Fanta and rainbow sherbert as the ice cream. The flavor is really hard to describe, but it's like the perfect sweet and citrusy mix. It came to be on complete accident, but I get it almost every time I go to this restaurant. </p>
